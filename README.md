## Installation

No installation required to use this app.

## Objectives 

Currently, the website is a prototype. The idea behind Tech It Out is for it to become a Reddit-meets-Stack Overflow social platform where programmers can interact with other programmers and engage in fun activities that make learning programming easier. We want it to be a one-stop-shop for beginners - where they can find helpful resources and start building their network.

Ideas for expansion:
- Bigger library of resources and a more robust user interface.
- Mentorship program where users can volunteer to become mentors. Users can just browse through the platform and find a mentor.
- Better community features:
    - in-app messaging
    - reward system for those who contribute the most
    - contests
    - weekly showcase of members' works
